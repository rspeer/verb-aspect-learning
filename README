This is the code to accompany "Modeling Verb Lexicalization Biases using
Hierarchical Bayesian Models", by Catherine Havasi and Robert Speer (2011).

``mannerpath.py`` contains the main model code, which will produce a stream of
results for a specified experimental condition. ``graph.py`` will make various
graphs of these results, as in the paper, once enough results have been
collected.
